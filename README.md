- 👋 Hi all, I’m Ivan!
- 👀 I’m interested in getting some practical skills in all-things Python, curious to learn more and get to know this language even more!
- Python is my first programming language learned. Got lots of theory but I was always more of practical guy.
- Hopefully I will be able to contribute to this great site, altough superrrr new to Git (and still feel heavily intimidated by not pressing something wrong)...

- 🌱 PF member.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collab on all kinds of projects!
- 📫 How to reach me -> ping me here!
