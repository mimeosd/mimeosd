- 👋 Hi all, I’m Ivan!
- 👀 I’m interested in getting some practical skills in all-things Python, curious to learn more and get to know this language even more!
- Python is my first programming language learned. Got lots of theory but I was always more of practical guy.
- Hopefully I will be able to contribute to this great site, altough superrrr new to Git (and still feel heavily intimidated by not pressing something wrong)...
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and scratched C a little though just reading about it. Wanted to get a grasp of how it works, nothing big.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Matplotlib. :D
- 📫 How to reach me -> ping me here!
